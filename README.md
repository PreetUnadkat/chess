This is my first serious project, where I aim to build a complete chess game from scratch using Ruby. Starting from a terminal-based game, I plan to expand it step by step, eventually making it a fully functional web-based chess platform with an AI engine.
*Planned Features (in order)*
- [ ] *Terminal-based Chess Game* → Two manual players, following all rules (including checkmate, en passant, promotion and castling).
- [ ] *Toggle Possible Moves* → Add an option to highlight legal moves on the board and add unlimited undo option!
- [ ] *Web Version* → Move from the terminal to a website and publish on GitHub Pages.
- [ ] *API & AI Integration* → Implement an AI opponent or allow scripted move sequences.
- [ ] *Custom Chess Engine → Develop my own chess engine and integrate it.
- [ ] *Online Multiplayer* → Play with random people or AI over the internet (may require a server setup).
