This is my first serious project, where I aim to build a complete chess game from scratch using Ruby. Starting from a terminal-based game, I plan to expand it step by step, eventually making it a fully functional web-based chess platform with an AI engine.
*Planned Features (in order)*
- [ ] *En passant* and *stalemate*
- [ ] *Move logs* and unlimited undo option!
- [ ] *API & AI Integration* → Implement an AI opponent or allow scripted move sequences.
- [ ] *Variants*, *Timer*
- [ ] *Analysis*, Hints
- [ ] *Web Version* → Move from the terminal to a website and publish on GitHub Pages.
- [ ] Custom *Chess Engine* → Develop my own chess engine and integrate it, *rating system* to rate it and players.
- [ ] *Online Multiplayer* → Play with random people or AI over the internet.
- [ ] *AI-Generated Commentary*
